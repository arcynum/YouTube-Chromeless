This is a forked version of davist11 (Trevor Davis)'s Youtube Embedding.
This version is essentially the same, except its has removed some of the features.

This will essentially display only the Chromeless Youtube Video.
You click the video to start, and click it again to pause/resume the video.
The volume is set to max(100).

This was used for a simple promotional video embed, but some other people may want a "Just Video" version.

The majority of the code here is still Copyright to Trevor Davis, however there are some changes/small additions which are my own.

A jQuery plugin to hook into the YouTube Chromeless Video API.

Sample Usage:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxUjB3Q04rQ" class="video-link">Bolt Arms - Around the World</a>

$(document).ready(function() {
  $('a.video-link').ytchromeless();
});


Requirements:
- jQuery: http://jquery.com/
- SWFObject: http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/


Options:
- videoWidth : '640'
- videoHeight : '360'
- videoIdBase : 'ytplayer'
- params : { allowScriptAccess: 'always', wmode: 'transparent' }
